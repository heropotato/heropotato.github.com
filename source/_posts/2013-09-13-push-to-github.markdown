Since graduated from [NEU][] with a M.S degree, I have been on job-hunting journey. Meanwhile, my interview preparations primarily focus on whiteboard coding practices. Being tired of looking for appropriate coding practices online until find out [LeetCode online judge][].

[LeetCode online judge][], covering most data structures and algorithms questions, is an effective way of preparing technical interviews in general. By cracking questions, I push my solutions to [GitHub repository][] for reviewing purposes. Some of solutions have been inspired by and have been learned from others' contributions on web.

In case of any issues or bugs in my solutions, please send an [email][] without any hesitation.
