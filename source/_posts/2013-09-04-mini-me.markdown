Introducing Mr.**Wyatt**, the minion version of me. In his entire life so far, he allocates attentions on everything that seems attractive: {" The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"}. In person, I would get him adquately prepared when he hitting the road, if I could. Apparently, that is not what happened. Enjoy your journey on planet earth, my dear **Wyatt**.
