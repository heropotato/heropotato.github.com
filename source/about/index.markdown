Hello, world!

I'm Yong WEN, a back-end developer with M.S degree in Information Systems from [Northeatern University][neuURL], a husband with marriage certificate from [City of Malden][maldenURL], and a father.

In the last decade, I used to work as editor, photographer and developer. Although job functionalities are completely different, one thing is in common: modeling the real world.
 
When surfing the Internet, I would like to pin what I like on [Pinterest][PinterestURL], take a glance at tweets on [Twitter][TwitterURL], and read what great minds on [Medium][MediumURL]. 

If you want to keep in touch, send an [email][emailURL] or check my professional profile via [LinkedIn][LinkedInURL].
